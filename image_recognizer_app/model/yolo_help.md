# How to download Weight and cfg files for YOLO model?

1. For download the weights and cfg files for YOLO please go to this page:
https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

2. Go to the section "Performance on the COCO Dataset"

3. Choose YOLOv3-320, YOLOv3-416, YOLOv3-608, YOLOv3-tiny or YOLOv3-spp. I recommend YOLOv3-320 because is not a heavy file and works fine on most PC. If you choose another one keeps in mind that consumes more CPU, and the program runs slower. Once you have chosen the one that best suits your needs, you need to download the weight and cfg files. Please read the next steps.

4. Click on the "weight" link and will start the download.

5. When you click on cfg file this will open a GitHub page. If you don't know how to download a GitHub file please check this link:

6. Once you have all the necessary files, move the files to the same level of this file and run the program.
